# GLAD

- **Purpose**: GLAD is an OpenGL loading library that helps developers manage and load OpenGL functions. OpenGL is a graphics API that provides a broad set of features for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, but due to its versioning and the way it exposes functions, developers need a way to dynamically load these functions at runtime.

- **Functionality**: GLAD generates a set of functions that allows users to call OpenGL functions according to the version and extensions they want to use. It provides a simple interface to initialize and load OpenGL functions, making it easier for developers to work with various OpenGL contexts without worrying about compatibility issues.

- **Customization**: Developers can configure GLAD to include specific OpenGL versions and extensions during the generation process, which means they only include the functions they need for their applications.
